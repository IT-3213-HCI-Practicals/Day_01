## ðŸ›  Software & Tools Used  
- **Axure RP** â€“ For UI/UX design and prototyping  
- **Git & GitHub** â€“ For version control and repository management  

## ðŸš€ How to Open and View the Designs  
1. **Download** the `one.rp` files from this repository.  
2. Open **Axure RP** on your computer.  
3. Click **File > Open** and select the downloaded `.rp` file.  
4. Use the **Preview** button in Axure to interact with the prototype.
